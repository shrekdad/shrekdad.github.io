# Privacy Policy for PomPom

**Effective Date: February 16, 2026**

PomPom ("we", "us", or "our") operates the **PomPom** mobile application (the "App"), available on the Apple App Store.  

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information (if any) we collect through the App, how we use it, and your choices regarding that information.

**PomPom is a fun, local-only tool for creating personalized birthday party invitation cards. All processing happens exclusively on your device. We do not collect, transmit, store on servers, or share any personal data with us or any third parties.**

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

We **do not** collect any personal information from you. Specifically:

- No account creation or login is required
- No names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other contact information
- No device identifiers, IP addresses, precise location, advertising identifiers, or analytics data
- No crash reports, usage statistics, or performance data sent to us
- No data is ever sent to our servers or any cloud service

The App functions completely offline after it is downloaded.

## 2. Photos and Media You Provide

PomPom allows you to **optionally** import a single photo from your device's photo library to personalize a birthday invitation card (for example, by placing the photo into a festive template with party decorations such as hats, balloons, or cartoon effects).

### What happens when you import a photo:
- The App accesses **only the specific image** you select using Apple's standard Photos picker API.
- The photo is loaded **temporarily into the App's memory** on your device solely for generating the invitation card.

### Important limitations:
- We do **not** perform any facial recognition, facial mapping, facial landmark detection, depth analysis, biometric processing, or identification of any kind.
- The photo is treated purely as a user-provided image for simple visual compositing — similar to placing any photo into a greeting card frame.
- All image editing, compositing, and card generation occur **exclusively on your device** using standard iOS frameworks (e.g., Core Graphics, UIKit).

**No photo or derived content is ever uploaded, transmitted, stored on servers, or processed in the cloud.**

## 3. How We Use Photos and Generated Content

We use the photo you provide **only** to:

- Display it within the invitation card template for personalization
- Apply simple, user-selected local visual effects or overlays
- Generate a static invitation card image that you can preview, save to your Photos library, or share via the iOS system share sheet

Once you finish creating the card, close the editor, or cancel the process, the temporary photo data is **automatically released from memory**.  

We do **not** retain, analyze, profile, identify faces, or use the photo (or any content within it) for any other purpose.

## 4. Storage and Retention of Data

- **Temporary in-memory use only** — Imported photos exist only in volatile memory while you are actively creating or viewing a card. They are discarded immediately after the session ends.
- **No persistent storage by the App** — We do **not** save the original imported photo anywhere within the App.
- If you choose to save the final invitation card (a rendered composite image), it is saved directly to your device's **Photos library** using the standard iOS Photos API — this action is fully under your control.
- **User deletion** — You can delete any saved invitation cards from your Photos library or remove them from the App's saved items list (if applicable) at any time.

## 5. Sharing of Information

We do **not** share, disclose, transmit, sell, rent, or provide any user-provided photos, generated cards, or any other information to third parties.  

- No data ever leaves your device.
- The App does **not** integrate any third-party SDKs for analytics, advertising, crash reporting, social login, or any other purpose.

## 6. Children's Privacy

PomPom is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.  

If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child, please contact us at the email below.

## 7. Your Choices and Controls

- Importing a photo is **entirely optional** — you decide whether to use this feature.
- You control what happens to generated cards: save them, share them, or delete them.
- You can revoke the App's access to your photo library at any time via **iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Photos**.
- Since we collect no personal data, there are no accounts, profiles, or data to delete or export from our side.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App or applicable laws. The updated policy will be posted here with a revised **Effective Date**. We recommend reviewing this page periodically.
