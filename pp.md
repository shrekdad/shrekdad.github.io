# Privacy Policy for Wasabi

**Effective Date: February 16, 2026**

Wasabi Studio ("we", "us", or "our") operates the **Wasabi** mobile application (the "App"), available on the Apple App Store.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information is processed within the App, how it is used, how it is stored, and your rights regarding that information.

Wasabi is designed as a **local-only creative tool**. All processing happens entirely on your device. We do not operate servers and we do not collect or receive your personal data.

---

## 1. Overview of Data Practices

- No account creation is required  
- No personal information is collected by us  
- No data is transmitted to our servers  
- No cloud processing is used  
- The App functions fully offline after download  

All data remains on your device and under your control.

---

## 2. Photos You Provide

Wasabi allows you to optionally import photos from your device’s photo library to create personalized birthday invitation cards.

When you select a photo:

- The App accesses **only the specific image you choose** using Apple’s standard Photos picker API.
- The photo is processed locally on your device.
- We do not access your entire photo library.

## 3. Facial Landmark Detection (On-Device Only)

To properly position decorative elements (such as hats, party effects, or overlays), Wasabi uses Apple’s **Vision framework** to detect facial landmarks within the selected image.

### What is processed:

- Face bounding box  
- Facial landmark points (e.g., eye position, mouth position, face contour geometry)

### What is NOT performed:

- No facial recognition  
- No identity verification  
- No biometric template generation  
- No face embeddings  
- No comparison against any database  
- No attempt to identify any individual  

Facial landmark detection is used solely to calculate placement of visual decorations within the invitation design.

All face-related processing occurs **entirely on your device** using Apple’s system frameworks.

---

## 4. How We Use Photos and Landmark Data

Imported photos and generated facial landmark data are used only to:

- Position decorative elements correctly on the face  
- Generate a customized birthday invitation card  
- Allow you to preview, save, or share the final composite image  

The data is not used for:

- Advertising  
- Analytics  
- Tracking  
- Profiling  
- Identification  
- Machine learning model training  

---

## 5. Storage and Retention

Wasabi does not transmit any data off your device.

### Local Storage

- Facial landmark data is stored locally as part of the project data on your device.  
- Imported photos remain in your device’s Photos library.  
- The App does not upload or back up this data to any external servers.  

### Retention Period

Facial landmark data and related project data are retained only for as long as you keep the project within the App.

You may delete imported photos and associated project data at any time. Once deleted, the data is permanently removed from the App.

## 6. Sharing of Information

We do not:

- Share data with third parties  
- Sell or rent data  
- Use analytics SDKs  
- Use advertising SDKs  
- Use crash reporting services  
- Integrate social login systems  

No data ever leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to share a generated invitation using the iOS system share sheet.

---

## 7. User Control

You have full control over your data:

- Importing photos is optional.  
- You may delete projects and associated data at any time.  
- You may revoke photo access at any time via:  

  **iOS Settings > Privacy & Security > Photos**

Since we do not collect or store data on servers, there is no external account data to request, export, or delete.

---

## 8. Children's Privacy

Wasabi is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction).

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Because all processing occurs locally and no data is transmitted to us, we do not receive or store children's data.

---

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. Updates will be posted with a revised **Effective Date**.

We encourage you to review this page periodically.
